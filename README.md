# Net Project: Dialogue Bot


This is the final work on [Network Technologies](http://acm.mipt.ru/twiki/bin/view/Networks), a course by [Dmitry Podlesnykh](http://wikimipt.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%90%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87) at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)](https://mipt.ru/english/).

A chatbot is running on the Amazon server... And one can have a talk with it!

## Project Structure

There are two folders: *client* and *server*.

In *client* folder there are [python client](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/client/client.py) and [C# client](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/client/client.cs) with corresponding [exe file](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/client/client.exe).

*Server* folder contains

* [Python server](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/server/server.py)
* [Chatbot](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/server/chatbot.py)
* And numerous files connected with Chatbot's training and functioning. Eager readers can find all the details about Chatbot in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/server/exploring_chatbot.ipynb)



## Requirements

There are two ways to chat with the bot

* Download [binary client](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/client/client.exe). If you use Windows, just run it. If you are on Ubuntu, or Mac, or some other OS, try installing [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) first, which is a "cross platform and open source .NET framework". In Ubuntu, for example, it accomplishes by typing a command

  `sudo apt-get install monodevelop mono-utils`

  After that you can run the bot

  `mono client.exe`

  You can even compile its [C# code](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/client/client.cs), for whatever it is you need :)

  `dmcs client.cs` 

* Download [python client](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/client/client.py). In order to make it work, one should also have Python 3 installed on the PC. If you don't have it, you can get using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python).

  And to connect with the bot, type

  `python3 client.py`


If you managed to complete either step from above, I assume that you also have Internet connection. It is also important :)


## Usage

Just type something, some sentence or phrase, and press `Enter`.

Not long after that you will see the Chatbot's answer. If it is still running on the server :)

If you want to finish the dialog, type *Ciao!* or *ciao!* (or, actually, any other upper-lower case *ciao* combination with one exclamation mark *!* after).

Here is an example of a dialog (or rather a series of question-answer pairs) with Bot (generated by running [ChatBot.py](https://github.com/Alvant/Net-Project/blob/master/server/chatbot.py) as main program)

> How are you?
>
> fine cant you see so yourself

> What's is your name?
>
> Dale. Dale Barbara

> I want something to drink
>
> mmm... sorry, i've forgot anything about it

> Where can I buy a guitar?
> 
> sorry, i don't know...

> What will the weather be like tomorrow?
> 
> how did you get in here

> Nice shot!
> 
> thank you sir

> How old are you?
> 
> Well, you know, I'm a bot actually. There is no such a notion for me as age. I' supposed to tell you that I'm 30 years old. But my programm's been running for a just couple of days

> Tell me something I don't know
> 
> a deer

> Do you like The Godfather movie?
> 
> very much

> Let's rob a bank, Billy!
> 
> what a coincidence! i also want to know the answer to this question

> Bye
> 
> have a nice outing you lot

The work in general is, in fact, a mixture of several homeworks on two courses from [Coursera platform](https://www.coursera.org/)

* [NLP course by Higher School of Economics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing) (and I want to single out the chatbot-assignment from the final week)
* [Python course by MIPT (in Russian)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-in-python) (special thanks for the topic *Multi-threaded and asynchronous programming* covered in the final week)
